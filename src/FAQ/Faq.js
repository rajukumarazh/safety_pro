            content:`Web browsing on your computer is designed to be a smooth and enjoyable experience, and not one cluttered by annoying ads, which can take up valuable screen space, slow down webpage loading times, and eat up valuable bandwidth. That's why browsers include native support for third-party content blockers.

            Content blockers prevent ads like popups and banners from loading on websites you visit, and may also disable cookies, beacons, and the like to prevent online tracking and protect your privacy. Occasionally, however, they may unintentionally block a page element that you need access to, like a web form, for example.
            
            If you suspect that a content blocker you installed is disabling a useful webpage element, or you just want to temporarily disable all blocking in your current browsing session, here's how to turn it off.
            
            In Safari: Go to Settings for the Safari Browser.
            
            Launch Safari on your iOS device and navigate to the site in question.
            Go to Settings in Mac Book or tap the "aA" icon in the top-left corner of the screen to reveal the Website View menu.
            Tap Turn Off Content Blockers.
            In Mozilla Firefox:
            
            Open Firefox.
            Load the site that you want to disable from Content Blocking.
            Click the Shield button next to the URL in the address bar.
            Click the Turn off Blocking for This Site button.

                        but corporate or home networks are much less robust. While most networks have a set speed, there are many factors that effect the speed to your machine. Example: If your network has 10Mps download and 0.6 upload (minimum required) , this would be enough to operate the training system. However, if others are using the same network system resources at the same time you are training,
                         they may interfere with your download,
                         but most importantly your upload of data to the server.
                        When an Error Message appears while the course player is in operation indicating a slow network connection, STOP TRAINING and login to a more robust, faster internet connection or the progress made in the lessons will not be recorded properly in the grade reporting system. A desktop wired computer will provide the best educational experience and technical reporting of your training as required by the FAA.
